### iPhone Sideloading: How I Install All the Apps Without a Jailbreak
If you‚Äôre like me and love having more apps on your iPhone than Apple thinks you should, you‚Äôve probably run into the same problem: sideloading. I use Sidestore to sideload apps, which basically means I'm installing apps outside the appstore without any jailbreak. Here‚Äôs how I manage to sideload more than 3 apps (thanks to [Live Container](https://github.com/khanhduytran0/LiveContainer)) and what I do to keep them up and running.

### The Setup: Sidestore + Wireguard = üî•
So, Sidestore is my go-to, you can use AltStore as well but it requires your Laptop/Desktop to be on and connected to the same network in order to sign the IPAS, so i find sidestore to be more convenient. It's kinda easy to setup(look up online for tutorials0, and when paired with Wireguard VPN, you can sign your apps remotely with JIT. With this combo, I get apps on my phone that Apple would never approve like modded apps. But, of course, it‚Äôs not that easy. Every 7 days, I‚Äôve got to re-sign the IPAs ‚Äì yeah, that part's a pain, but it‚Äôs worth it for the sake of trolling apple.

#### Sidestore: This lets me install apps outside the App Store without jailbreaking. Pretty sweet, right?
#### Wireguard VPN: It's needed for the sideloading process. Just set up a VPN tunnel using the config file and sidestore connects to a virtual mac(dont worry this is safe as its an imaginary mac creared by the JIT setup).

### Installing More Than 3 Apps? 
Now, Apple has this retarded rule where you can‚Äôt install more than 3 apps with a free developer account(proper developer accounts cost 200 dollar per month‚ò†Ô∏è). But there‚Äôs always a way around that. I use Live Container to install multiple apps. It‚Äôs a bit of a hack, but it works like a charm. Basically, I can load up as many apps as I want.

### The Catch: Re-Signing Every 7 Days
Here‚Äôs the annoying part: every 7 days, I‚Äôve got to re-sign the IPAs. If you don‚Äôt, the apps just stop working, which can be a bit of a headache but there are shortcuts which will automate all this process, so you dont have to worry about forgetting to sign the IPAs 

### Why I Do It
I know, this sounds like a lot of hassle. But for me, it‚Äôs worth it. I get to use apps that Apple would never allow in the App Store, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about jailbreaking my phone. Plus, there's something satisfying about beating the system. Apple is also a very corny and cringe and a goofball company i hate apple with all my core kys apple kys

If you‚Äôre cool with signing apps every 7 days and want the freedom to install whatever apps you want, give Sidestore and Wireguard a try. Just don‚Äôt forget to set that shortcut for automations as it will take care of the resigning process!
